- 👋 Hi, I’m @frivolouslabs. I've spent the past 6 years in non-dev roles across trading and start ups - I'm teaching myself mobile development to build some of my ideas. 
- 👀 I’m interested in mobile development for iOS apps.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SwiftUI to make an app I've dreamed about building for a while
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on consumer social apps & animations. 
- 📫 How to reach me - you can find a way if you really want to.
